To get your computer ready to run Python:

	Go To https://www.python.org/downloads/
	There will be a button to download python underneath the text:
	"Download the latest version for Windows"

	When you click that button, an installer will download onto your computer.
	IMPORTANT: When you run the installer, you will see a screen with an
		options saying: "Install Now" and "Customize Installation"
		Before you press the button that says install now,
		Go To The Bottom And Check The Box That Says "Add Python to PATH"
		Without clicking this option, your computer will not know that python
		was installed and you won't be able to follow the next steps.

	There is one additional library that we will need to install for python.
	To do this, open windows command prompt.
	If you do not know how to open windows command prompt, click the start menu
	icon on the bottom of your computer screen.
	Type "command prompt" into the search bar, and Windows command prompt should
	pop up.

	Type the two commands: "python --version" and "pip --version"

	These will verify that you have python working on your computer and
	that you have pip, a program to download python libraries, on your computer.
	(pip downloads with python)

	Next, type the command: "pip install pygame"

	This will install the pygame library onto your computer and you should be
	able to run the python code now.


	If you were unsuccessful in getting pygame onto your computer,
